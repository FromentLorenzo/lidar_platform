    :alt: Rennes LiDAR Platform

The LiDAR platform, in Rennes (`<https://lidar.univ-rennes.fr>`_), aims at developping tools to process point clouds, with a preference for environmental sciences but not only. We develop tools in C++ directly for CloudCompare, but we also develop in Python, or Matlab.

The ``lidar_platform`` Python library contains some helping tools we are using daily (for some of them). Should you be interested in using it, do no hesitate.
