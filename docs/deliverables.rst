Build
=====

We have helper functions to generate deliverables as DTM, DSM, DCM, which make calls to `lastools blast2dem` (not free
unfortunately) and to
*gdal* (thank you OSGeo!). Under Windows, *gdal* can be installed with OsGeo4W (`<https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w)>`_. Once
installed, add *C:\QGIS* or *C:\OSGeo4W* to your path, it depends on your configuration.
